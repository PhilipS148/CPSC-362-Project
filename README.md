### Brief Overview
This project is an interactive website for a made up taco resturant named Tuffy Taco's. The website includes functions such as creating an account, loggin, logout, viewing a menu, adding to cart, checkout, and viewing previous order history.

### Functionality 
This project utilizes a python backend with a User, Cart-Checkout, and Food class as well as a html, css, and JaveScript frontend. It also utilizes a Flask server in our server.py file, fLask is a lightweight Python web framework that handels routing templating, and request processing. This alows us to connect our python backend to our frontend. The website can be ran locally with the command 'python server.py' and following the link given http://127.0.0.1:5000.

### Testing
The test.py file can be ran through the terminal. This tests all the backend logic with no frontend implementation. It acts as an interactive menu through the terminal and allowed us to ensure that all out backend logic was working as intended as well as error checking.
